Back in December 2016, two of our oldest members, Augustin and Mihnea, decided that the club had to go back to its roots and give a new opportunity for the students that have just started debating, by hosting a tournament made specifically for them!

With approval from the all the trainers, in less than 3 weeks the tournament was done which was a success for everyone involved, as the team of 2 conveners mentioned earlier and 6 volunteers have succeeded to organize the accomodation and the tournament experience for 150 participants with no issues. 

Having great results, the 2nd edition featured an expanded orgcomm and more volunteers, establishing NextGen as a staple for the training of the next generations in competitive debating.
